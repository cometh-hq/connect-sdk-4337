# Connect SDK

Cometh Connect SDK allows developers to onboard their users with a seedless, gasless experience familiar to Web2 using Biometrics and web2 logins.

Account Abstraction (AA) improves transaction user experience by using smart contract wallets as primary accounts.

If you need more information on how to use the SDK check our [documentation](https://docs.cometh.io/connect/cometh-connect/what-is-connect)
